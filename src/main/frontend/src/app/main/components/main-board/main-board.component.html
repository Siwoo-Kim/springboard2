          Lists with inset dividers
          Dividers can be added to lists as a means of separating content into distinct sections. Inset dividers can also be added to provide the appearance of distinct elements in a list without cluttering content like avatar images or icons. Make sure to avoid adding an inset divider to the last element in a list, because it will overlap with the section divider.
